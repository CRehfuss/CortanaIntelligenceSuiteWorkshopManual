# Building Your First Azure Machine Learning Pipeline

This tutorial has two exercises. First, you will create a machine learning model from scratch using Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) and predefined data sets (historical flight data and historical weather data). This exercise also has you operationalizing your completed model as a web service that is callable from any other application. The second exercise will actually have you integrating the operationalized web service with a web application and deploying to Azure. 

# Requirements

These exercises require an Azure subscription. If you do not have access to an Azure subscription through your organization or MSDN, you can create a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
