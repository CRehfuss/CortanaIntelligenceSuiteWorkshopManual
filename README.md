# Building Your First Azure Machine Learning Pipeline

This tutorial has two exercises. First, you will create a machine learning model from scratch using Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) using predefined data sets (historical flight data and historical weather data). In this exercise you will operationalize your completed ML model as a web service that can be called from any application. In the second exercise you will integrate the operationalized web service with a web application and deploy it to Azure.

# Requirements

These exercises require an Azure subscription. If you do not have access to an Azure subscription through your organization or MSDN, you can create a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
